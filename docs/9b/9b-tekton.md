Part 9B: Creating a Tekton Pipeline
===================================


1 - IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery -- Tekton Pipeline
-----------------------------------------------------

Note: This tutorial will assume you have already setup as described in
Part 9 -- Section 4.

This tutorial will go step by step on how to create a tekton pipeline
for the Web frontend microservice. To get start, navigate to the
zero-to-cloud-native-toolchain you created in part 9 for this series.

## 1 - 1 GitHub Integration

The first thing you need to do is connect your SCM (Source Code
Management) repository with the toolchain. You do this by clicking add
tool and then selecting SCM (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or GitHub
Enterprise Whitewater).

Note: Repositories can be Public or Private. In this tutorial, I will be
the public repository that I've shared and that you clone in part 8. By
default, I recommend setting your repositories to private unless you
plan to share them publicly. This way, if you make a mistake and upload
something like an API key, you are still protected.

Note: if this is the first time you are creating a toolchain with a
GitHub repository, you will first need to Authorize IBM Cloud to access
GitHub. You can follow the instructions here if needed:

<https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-integrations#github>

On the next screen, select **GitHub**.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

Select **Existing** as the repository type and enter the repository URL
for your git repository that you setup in Part 8 of this tutorial
series. Click **Create Integration** after entering these settings.

1 - 2 Create Delivery Pipeline
-------------------------------

The next tool we need to add is a Delivery Pipeline. Click on **add
tool** and then click on the **Delivery Pipeline tile**.

![A picture containing bird, flower, tree Description automatically
generated](.//media/image4.png)

On the next screen, give you delivery pipeline a name, I will use
**dev-tekton-frontend-web-pipeline**. For this part of the tutorial,
keep **tekton** selected as the Pipeline type, and click **Create
Integration**.

### 1-2-1 Add the Continuous Delivery Service

Note: If you are following the tutorial and created the continuous
delivery service as you created a classic pipeline, you can skip this
part and proceed to part 1-3. You only have to create one instance of
the continuous delivery service.

On the next screen, you will see all the tools we have added to our
toolchain. The next step is to configure the delivery pipeline we just
created. You will also see the following warning notice.

![A close up of a sign Description automatically
generated](.//media/image6.png)

You have 5 days to use the service for free. If you want to use the
service more than 5 days, click on **Add the service**.

The first step on the next page is to select a region and plan. Keep the
region as **Dallas**, like all our other resources, and you can also
keep the plan selected as **Lite**.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image7.png)

Scrolling down, you need to give you service a name and indicate which
resource group to place it in. I will use **Continuous
Delivery-zero-to-cloud-native** as the name and select
**zero-to-cloud-native** as the resource group.

After entering those settings, click on **Create**.

1 - 3 Configure your Delivery Pipeline
---------------------------------------

Navigate back to the toolchain you just created by clicking on the IBM
Cloud hamburger menu and **select DevOps**.

![A screenshot of a cell phone screen with text Description
automatically
generated](.//media/image9.png)

On the next screen, select **Dallas** as the location your toolchain is
in and then click on the **toolchain name**.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image10.png)

On the next screen, click on the **Delivery Pipeline** tile that you
just created.

### 

### 1-3-1 Pipeline Definitions

Add the tekton pipeline definition by clicking on the Add button,
selecting the repository, branch and the path to the tekton pipeline
definition files.

Note: Pipeline definition should be in the directory named as
**.tekton.** You will find the .tekton folder with all the pipeline
definition files already in a .tekton folder in all the repositories.

Pipeline definition can be defined as Tekton Resource definitions that
create a Tekton PipelineRun. It \"runs\" a pipeline that builds the
application into an image, scans the image for vulnerabilities, and then
deploys the application with IBM Cloud Redhat OpenShift Service.

Tekton pipeline definitions are stored in source repositories.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image12.png)

On the definitions tab, click on add to add a new definition. The
definition will indicate which git repository we want to use along with
specifying the branch.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image13.png)

Enter the repository name that you clone in part 8 of this series. In
this example, we are using the web-frontend repository and the dev
branch. Then click Add.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image14.png)

On the next screen, click Save.

### 1-3-2 Tekton Definitions

Before we go through the next steps, let's review the pipeline
definitions we will be using.

In our case we have three files (listener.yaml, pipeline.yaml and
tasks.yaml) that describe our Tekton pipeline.

-   **listener.yaml:** In a nutshell listener.yaml file contains all the
    configurations needed to trigger a pipeline. Usually a listener.yaml
    file contains three different Tekton objects known as
    TriggerTemplate, TriggerBinding and EventListener described in them.

(Note: Details about TriggerTemplate, TriggerBinding and EventListener
are provided in detail in Section 1-3-4)

-   **pipeline.yaml** contains information regarding the task and in
    which sequence tasks should be executed. It has a Tekton object
    known as a pipeline which allow us to define what tasks will be
    executed when the pipeline runs.

-   **tasks.yaml** contains information about each task, steps that
    build that task and their execution. For example in our case
    task.yaml has 3 tasks, Build-task, validate-task and deploy-task.
    Build-task is divided into two different steps know as clone-repo
    and build-docker-image. The clone-repo step pulls the git repository
    containers, all the application code, and Dockerfile from the SCM
    and then the build-docker-image step builds the container image and
    pushes it to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

### 1-3-3 Worker Configuration

When it comes to worker configuration, we have two options to either use
the Managed worker provided by IBM or private workers i.e. run the
pipeline server and runner in your own OpenShift cluster.

**Note:** Private workers currently are not supported with OpenShift so
we will be using IBM Managed Workers.

Click on worker on the left side and select the IBM Managed workers (
Tekton Pipelines)

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image15.png)

Once the worker is selected click on save button.

### 

### 1-3-4 Trigger Configuration

Tekton triggers allow users to create resource templates that get
instantiated when an event is received. Additionally, fields from event
payloads can be injected into these resource templates as runtime
information. This enables users to automatically create templated
PipelineRun or TaskRun resources when an event is received.

Tekton Triggers introduce three Kubernetes custom resources to configure
triggers:

1.  **TriggerTemplates**

> A
> [TriggerTemplate](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/docs/triggertemplates.md)
> declares a blueprint for each Kubernetes resource you want to create
> when an event is received. Each TriggerTemplate has parameters that
> can be substituted anywhere within the blueprint you define. In
> general, you will have one TriggerTemplate for each of your Tekton
> Pipelines. In this tutorial, you create a TriggerTemplate for your
> build-and-deploy PipelineRun because you want to create a
> build-and-deploy PipelineRun every time you receive a pull request
> event.

2.  **TriggerBindings**

> A
> [TriggerBinding](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/docs/triggerbindings.md)
> describes what information you want to extract from an event to pass
> to your TriggerTemplate. Each TriggerBinding essentially declares the
> parameters that get passed to the TriggerTemplate at runtime (when an
> event is received). In general, you will have one TriggerBinding for
> each type of event that you receive. In this tutorial, you will create
> a TriggerBinding for the GitHub pull request event in order to build
> and deploy the code in the pull request.

3.  **EventListeners**

> An
> [EventListener](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/docs/eventlisteners.md)
> creates a Deployment and Service that listen for events. When the
> EventListener receives an event, it executes a specified
> TriggerBinding and TriggerTemplate. In this tutorial, the
> EventListener will receive pull request events from GitHub and execute
> the TriggerBinding and TriggerTemplate to create a build-and-deploy
> PipelineRun.

There are multiple options of trigger you can have with tekton pipeline
in the toolchains. For example **Manual**, **Git Repository**,
**Timed**, and **Generic Webhook**. Depending upon your use case and
preference you can use one of them.

In our case we are going to use Git Repository i.e. whenever a commit is
pushed, the pipeline runs.

Click on **Triggers**, **Add trigger** button, and then select **Git
Repository**.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image16.png)

Next, edit maximum concurrent runs to **1**.

Select the web-frontend-02cn repository.

Keep the dev Branch selected and select **When a commit is pushed**.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](.//media/image17.png)

The Event listener and Worker option will be automatically populated
with the values as per Tekton definition configured in Pipeline
Definitions step and worker configuration step.

After entering all of these details, click on **Save**.

### 

### 1-3-5 GitHub Token

If you are following the tutorial and using private GitHub repositories,
you will need to get a GitHub token. Best practice is to use a unique
GitHub token per project so that you can revoke the token if it becomes
compromised without effecting your other repositories.

To create a GitHub token, go to GitHub.com. After logging in, click on
your ID and then select settings.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image18.png)

Next, click on Developer Settings.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image19.png)

Next, click on Personal access tokens.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image20.png)

Next, click on Generate new token.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image21.png)

Give your key or token a name, such as zero-to-cloud-native. Since this
is a token that I'm not going to share with anyone, I will select every
option under select scopes.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image22.png)

After entering all of these settings, click on Generate Token.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image23.png)

On the next screen, you will see your token. Store this in a save place,
we will be using this token in the next step.

Important: This is your only time to copy the token, after you navigate
away from this screen you will not have access to view the token.

### ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](.//media/image24.png)

### 1-3-6 Environment Properties

If you are following the tutorial and using private github repositories,
you will need to get a github token. Best practice is to use a unique
github token per project so that you can revoke the token if it becomes
compromised without effecting your other repoes.

In order to build and deploy to your own cluster we need to configure
some parameter so that we can get access to Container registry and the
OpenShift Cluster. In our case we have 10 parameters to define the above
access. The 10 parameters are as follows.

-   **apikey**: An IBM Cloud API Key.

-   **cluster**: The name of your OpenShift cluster where you will be
    deploying the application. I will be using **zero-to-cloud-native.**

-   **clusterNamespace**: The namespace in your cluster where the app
    will be deployed. I will be using **zero-to-cloud-native.**

-   **clusterRegion:** The region where your OpenShift cluster is
    located -- I will be using **us-south.**

-   **registryNamespace:** The IBM Cloud Container Registry namespace
    where the app image will be built and stored. I will be using
    **zero-to-cloud-native**, make sure to select the namespace you
    created.

-   **registryRegion:** The region where your IBM Cloud Container
    Registry is located. I will be using **us-south.**

-   **repository:** The source git repository where your resources are
    cloned. Enter the name of your Github Repository that you created in
    Part 8. The repository must also contain the Git Token you created
    in the previous step. https://\<token\>\@github.com/owner/repo.git

-   **revision:** The branch of the source git repository where your
    resources are cloned. We are simulating a dev branch, so enter
    **dev**.

-   **imageName:** name of the image including the registry. In this
    example, we will be using:
    **us.icr.io/zero-to-cloud-native/web-frontend-02cn.** Note, you will
    need to replace the zero-to-cloud-native with the registry namespace
    you created.

-   **deploymentFile:** location and name of the deployment file. In
    this case, we will be using deployments/deployment.yaml as this is
    where the deployment file is located in all of our repositories.

Click on the Environment tab and enter the following paraments by click
on **Add property** button.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image25.png)

Note: You will get different options when you click the add property
button such **Integration, Secure, Single Select, Text, Text Area.**
Functionality of each option is different such **integration** provides
access to values stored in different tools inside toolchains, a
**secure** option will mask the entered values, **text area** will
provide a text box with 3-4 which can be used to add scripts etc.

The first type we are going to enter is Secure Field. In this case I
will be using the **Secure** as the GitHub API will be used in
repository specification.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image26.png)

Next, enter repository as the name and then your github repository name.
In my example, I will use
<https://8d5472cea0cc588f62efed4237119@github.com/kmcolli/web-frontend-02cn.git>

The convention is https://\<git-token\>/@github.com/\<owner\>/repo-name

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image27.png)

Next, we are going to enter a secured text property to store our IBM
Cloud API Key. Click on Add property and then select Secure.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image28.png)

On the next screen, enter apikey as the name and paste you apikey as the
secured property.

The remaining properties are all text properties. For each property in
the table below, click on Add property, select Text and then enter the
property field name and value:

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image29.png)

  * **cluster**             Name of your cluster. e.g. zero-to-cloud-native

  * **clusterNamespace**    Kubernetes Namespace / OpenShift Project where you are deploying the tutorial application. e.g. zero-to-cloud-native
  
  * **clusterRegion**       Region your cluster is in. e.g. us-south
  
  * **registryNamespace**   Namespace of your IBM Cloud Container Registry service where you are storing your images. e.g. zero-to-cloud-native
  
  * **registryRegion**      Region of your IBM Cloud Container Registry. e.g. us-south
  
  * **revision**            Git branch. e.g. dev
  
  * **imageName**           Name of the complete image name such as: web-frontend-02cn
  
  * **deploymentFile**      deployments/deployment.yaml

Note: the imageName can only contain lowercase characters.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image30.png)

After entering all of these settings, click on **Save**.

1 - 4 Testing the Tekton Pipeline.
-----------------------------------

To test our pipeline, all we have to do is make a change to the source
code and commit it to GitHub as we have configured our pipeline to
automatically start after a GitHub commit to our repository.

To make a change, start Visual Studio Code, and open the workspace you
created in step 5. Navigate to the web-frontend-02cn folder and click on
the Dockerfile. Simply add a new line anywhere in the file.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image31.png)

Save the changes and push the 'change' to GitHub. You can either use
GitHub desktop to push the changes as we did in part 9A. Or you can use
the following command line commands.

Open your terminal and follow these commands

-   **git add -A**

-   **git commit -m "Changes to the dockerfile"** (You will notice the
    highlighted changes which should only be adding the newline.)

-   **git push --set-upstream origin dev**

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image32.png)

Now, navigate back to your browser, click on the pipeline name and watch
it run!

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image33.png)

After a few minutes, you should see that the pipeline was built
successfully. If you click on the pipeline run name, you can view the
status of each step.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](.//media/image34.png)

This shows the parameters used, status and logs for each step in the
pipeline.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

1 - 5 Next Steps
-----------------

If this is first time you are going through this section in creating a
tekton pipeline, you should now have two of our 6 microservices
deployed.

In part 9B we created a classic pipeline for the **api-frontend-02cn**
microservice.

In this section, we just created a tekton pipeline for the
**web-frontend-02cn** microservice.

To complete the deployment of the tutorial application, you will need to
create CI/CD pipelines for the remaining microservices:

**enable-node-ssh-02cn**

**utility-02cn**

**load-ocp-versions-02cn**

**ocp-realtime-02cn**

Choose your favorite method of using either a classic or Tekton
pipeline. After you deploy these microservices, continue to part 9C
where we will test the application!
