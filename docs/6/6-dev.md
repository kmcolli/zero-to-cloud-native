Part 6: Setting Up and Configuring a Cloud-Native Development Environment
=========================================================================


1 - Development Environment 
===========================

There are many different tools you will use to develop a cloud-native
application from various CLIs, an IDE, and support tools. Setting up a
proper environment can make your development experience much more
productive. If you are new to cloud-native, it is worth the time to
setup a good development environment before starting to code. This
section will go through what I have found to be effective but certainly
not the only option. I'm always looking for new tools and techniques to
make my life easier. The tutorial here will focus on setting up a
development environment on a mac, if you are a windows user -- switch to
a mac .

## 1 - 1 Command Line Tools

If you don't already use the command line / terminal you should. It is
an essential tool and skill that is essential when it comes to
cloud-native. For example, with OpenShift the console is really great,
you can point and click and get all the information about your cluster
and workloads that you need. However, if you know how to use the oc (
Openshift ) cli or Kubernetes kubectl cli, you will be much more
productive. With the exception of GitHub, which I have a personal battle
with when it comes to the command line, I use the command line as much
as possible and find it to be much more productive.

2 - Terminal
============

The first thing you will want to setup is a good terminal. While the
terminal that comes with the mac is good, there are better alternatives.

## 2 - 1 iTerm2

I recommend iTerm2 as a great terminal for the mac.

To install iTerm2, run the command:

```
brew cask install iterm2
```

### 

### 

**Note:** if you have not installed homebrew yet, run this command in your terminal to install it.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
## 2 - 2 ZSH

Next, install zsh which is a shell designed for interactive use that will make you more productive. 

```
brew install zsh
```

## 2 - 3 OhMyZsh

Next up, we are going to install Oh My Zsh. "Oh My Zsh which is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration. It will not make you a 10x developer...but you might feel like one"
--- Robby Russell

To Inall OhMyZsh run this command:  
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
#### 

#### 2 - 3 - 1 Add Plugins to Oh My Zsh

You can add productivity plugins in zsh that will really make your life
easier. The plugins that I have installed that I found useful are:

**zsh-syntax-highlighting**


It enables highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an interactive terminal. This helps in reviewing commands before running them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

To install zsh-syntax-highlightin run:

```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
##  
**zsh-autosuggestions**

Suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.

To install zsh-autosuggestions run:
```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

**git**

The git plugin provides
many [aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git#aliases) and
a few
useful [functions](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git#functions).
It will also graphically show which branch you are on in your terminal

You do not need to install the git plugin, it comes with Oh My Zsh.

**history-substring-search**

history search feature, where you can type in any part of any command
from history and then press chosen keys, such as the UP and DOWN arrows,
to cycle through matches

To install history-substring-serach run:
```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search
```

**zsh-autocomplete**

Auto completes and corrects typos:

To install zsh-autocomplete run:
```
git clone https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autocomplete
```
2 - 4 kube-ps1: Kubernetes prompt
----------------------------------

A script that lets you add the current Kubernetes context and namespace
configured on kubectl to your Bash/Zsh prompt strings (i.e. the \$PS1).

To install run:  
```
brew install kube-ps1
```

2 - 5 Customizing .zshrc
-------------------------

Once you have all the plugins installed, you will need to add them to Oh
My Zsh. I've also created a couple of alias for commands I use
frequently that I will show you how to add those to your environment.

Edit the file /~/.zshrc  
```
vi ~/.zshrc
```

This is what the start of my \~/.zshrc file looks like :

```
# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.

export ZSH="/Users/kevincollins/.oh-my-zsh"
export K_KEY=<IBM CLOUD API KEY>
alias k=kubectl
alias ic=ibmcloud
alias vi="vim"
alias pm='podman-machine ssh fedbox sudo podman'

source "/usr/local/opt/kube-ps1/share/kube-ps1.sh"

plugins=(
zsh-syntax-highlighting
zsh-autosuggestions
git
history-substring-search
kubectl
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
PS1='$(kube_ps1)'$PS1
```


**export K\_KEY=\<IBM\_CLOUD\_APIKEY\>**

I added my IBM Cloud apikey to my environment variable as I use it many
times a day.

The following Alias are for frequent commands that I have shortened.

```
alias k=kubectl    
alias vi="vim"  
alias ic="ibmcloud"  
alias pm='podman-machine ssh fedbox sudo podman'   
```

Configure ZSH to use the kube-ps1 tool

```
source "/usr/local/opt/kube-ps1/share/kube-ps1.sh"
```
Plugins to add to Oh My Zsh

```
plugins=(
zsh-syntax-highlighting
zsh-autosuggestions
git
kubectl
history-substring-search
zsh-autocomplete
)
```

After the plugins section, you will see a line that starts with:

```
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

After this line, create a new line with the following:

```
PS1='$(kube_ps1)'$PS1
```

Next, we need to make the kube-ps1.sh script executable. Run the
following command in your terminal.

```
chmod +x "/usr/local/opt/kube-ps1/share/kube-ps1.sh"
```

ZSH Theme -- there are many you can choose from. I like spaceship the
best.

To install spaceship, you will need to install it like following the
same method we used to install the plugins.

```
git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt" --depth=1

ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme"
```
Next, we will need to run the following command to enable the terminal
to write to the filesystem.

```
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w,o-w
```

For your changes to the .zshrc file to take place run:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

After starting iterm2, your command line should look like this once you
log into a cluster.

3 - CLIs
--------

### 3 - 1 IBM Cloud

There are a number of CLIs that you will want to install that you will
frequently use.

The first one is the IBM Cloud CLI. Install the IBM Cloud CLI with this
command.

```
curl -fsSL https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/osx | sh
```

Next, you will need to install two frequently used plugins for IBM's
container service and container registry service.

```
ibmcloud plugin install container-service
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
```

### 3 - 2 Kubernetes

Even though we will be using OpenShift and have the oc cli available, I
still find myself frequently using the Kubernetes kubectl cli quite
often. To install kubectl, enter this command.

```
brew install kubectl
```

### 3 - 3 OC 
In this tutorial, we will be using the OpenShift cluster we created in part 4. We will be using the OpenShift CLI extensively. Download the latest OpenShift CLI **(oc)** for your local operating system and OpenShift version with the link below.

[OpenShift Container Platform 4 [oc] download
link](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/)

By default, the oc command comes unsigned from RedHat and you will not
be able to run the oc command from the terminal. To get around this,
navigate to where you downloaded the oc command and right click open.
This will ask you if you want to trust the oc command that you
downloaded.

Next, we will need to copy the command to our /usr/local/bin directory
by using the following command:

```
mv oc /usr/local/bin
```


4 - IDE
-------

Now that we have our terminal and CLIs setup, we can now install an IDE.
I use Visual Studio Studio code. If you have a different IDE you like
then that is great. I know a lot of Python developers prefer PyCharm as
an example. If you don't already have a favorite IDE, then Visual Studio
Code is a good first choice. In the tutorial and videos, I will be using
Visual Studio Code.

You can install Visual Studio Code by following the installation guide
here:

<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac>

### Installation

1.  [Download Visual Studio
    Code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106) for macOS.

2.  Open the browser's download list and locate the downloaded archive.

3.  Select the 'magnifying glass' icon to open the archive in Finder.

4.  Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder, making it
    available in the macOS Launchpad.

5.  Add VS Code to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon to bring up
    the context menu and choosing **Options**, **Keep in Dock**.

Visual studio code has a number of extensions to support the programming
languages that you use for development. The microservices in this
tutorial use Python so you will want to install the Python Extension for
Visual Studio Code.

You can find instructions to install the python extension here:

<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial>

5 Additional Tools
------------------

### 5 - 1 GitHub Desktop

I realize I will get a lot of flak from developer purists for using
GitHub Desktop and not the command line. I have a love / hate
relationship with GitHub from the terminal which has caused me a lot of
pain and suffering with losing and overwriting code. While certainly a
user error, I have resulting in using GitHub Desktop which I find very
easy to use.

Install GitHub Desktop here:

[https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

### 5 - 2 Postman

While developing, using, and sharing APIs, a great tool that I use
pretty much every day is Postman. In the part 1 introduction, I included
a postman link to all the APIs I created as part of CloudPak
Provisioner. It's a great tool for calling and running APIs. We will be
using Postman in this tutorial to test out the APIs we deploy.

Download and install postman here:

<https://www.postman.com/downloads/>

### 5 - 3 Docker

The last tool we will install is Docker. While developing a cloud-native
application, you will want to test your application locally before
committing your code to GitHub which will start the deployment process.

In this tutorial, we will also go through building your application
manually, so you can see all the steps that a CI/CD toolchain does for
you. In order to experience this, you will need Docker installed locally
on your machine.

You can download and install Docker by following these instructions:

[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
